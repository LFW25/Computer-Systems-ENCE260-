Welcome to Cave Runner, where you are a little man running through a cave.

As you run you must dodge various obstacles:
- Stalagtites will hang from the ceiling, requiring you to crouch underneath to avoid smacking your head!
- Bats will fly at your head, requiring you to crouch or doublejump to avoid colliding.
- Rocks will deviously trip you up, try jumping over them.
- Boulders will prevent you from continuing your caving dreams, you'll have to doublejump to get past.
- Tunnels will force you to squeeze through the middle, and only a jump will work.

But be careful, once you've moved, you're committed to that move for at least 4 pixels!
If you collide with any obstacles, that's game over! The game will end and you will see your score flashing.

This game is played in landscape mode to give you the advantage of more reaction time.
The USB connector is on the right-hand side.

To restart the game, hold down the top button (in landscape mode), press the reset button, and then release the top button.

CONTROLS:
Crouch - Down on the navswitch
Jump - Up on the navswitch
Doublejump - Press the navswitch

Pause - Left on the navswitch
Resume - Right on the navswitch
